Text as Data: A New Approach for Examining Equity in Education
* Investigate the role of carceral ideology, the propensity to solve problems through surveillance, coercion, and confinement—in limiting charter and traditional public schools’ potential to reduce inequality.
* Use text mining to construct a multidimensional measure of carceral ideology using words, phrases, and ideas from the handbooks of 11,381 U.S. public schools.
* Evaluate the extent to which schools serving larger minority student populations are more likely to use carceral language and have increased punishment frequency.
